# Alpa Chat

In this project we are using Webpacker gem to build our assets with Webpack while PostCSS and postcss-preset-env are processing our styles. Babel, Autoprefixer, and Browserslist allow us not worry about cross-browser issues. Our code is automatically checked for syntax errors with Prettier, AirBnB Base Config, ESLint, and stylelint on each git commit. The project was made following the guide at https://evilmartians.com/.
